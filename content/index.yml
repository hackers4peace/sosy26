  title: "[User-centric]{.text-primary} approach to applications"
  description:
    Email is even older The Web and it is still one of the most prevalent technologies.
    Besides freedom to choose which email provider's mail server we use,
    SMTP and IMAP allow us to choose freely which email client we want to interact with.
    Each user can even use different email clients on their different devices.
    One of the main promisses of Solid is to provide similar freedom to all our interactions online.
